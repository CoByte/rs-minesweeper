# cls-minesweeper

**cls-minesweeper** is a simple clone of minesweeper designed to be played in the terminal. It uses [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) so in theory it should be compatible with most terminals.

### How to Play

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the cursor around. Use Q to uncover, and E to flag. All rules are otherwise the same as normal minesweeper!

### Features

- [x] Various difficulties and fine grain control
- [x] Compatibility across all modern operating systems (untested :p)
- [x] Fun colors
- [ ] Local high score record
- [ ] Leaderboards(?)
- [ ] Key remaping/configuration changing

No promises that any of this will ever get added, but no ones going to use this anyways, so it should be ok.
